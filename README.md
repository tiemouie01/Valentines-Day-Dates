# Valentines Day Dates

Valentines Day Dates is simple UI illustration of a dating application on an Iphone 15 Pro. It makes use of pure HTML, CSS and Javascript for it's functionality.

## Overview

The page has 4 UIs. The first UI is the login UI which is rendered when a user account is present. The second UI is an overview page that is loaded when the "Log in" button is pressed. The overview page contains information about user matches.

The third UI is the signup UI which is rendered when a user account is not present. The second UI is the choosing page that continues the signing up process by allowing a user to select their preferred interest. When the signup process is completed, an "Account Created" alert is triggered and the UI is closed. The JSON of the new user's details is also output in the console.

All UIs allow you to close the application by clicking the home bar at the bottom of each phone screen. Pressing "Esc" on your keyboard will achieve the same effect.

## Additional Notes
- I ran into issues when attempting to load iframe using webpack, so the page does not make use of a module bundler despite most of the configurations being present.
